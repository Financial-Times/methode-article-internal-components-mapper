# Methode Article Internal Components Mapper
Methode Article Internal Components Mapper is a Dropwizard application which consumes Kafka events and maps raw Methode articles to internal content components.
The transformed content components are put back to Kafka.

## Introduction
This application depends on the following micro-services:

* kafka-proxy
* methode-article-mapper
* document-store-api
* public-concordances-api

Note: methode-article-mapper and public-concordances-api are used to validate the article if it's valid, and linked content in the body.
Document-store-api is used for both article validation and to resolve Content Placeholder UUIDs, that are pointing to and FT blog, to the original Wordpress UUID.

## Running

`java -jar target/methode-article-internal-components-mapper-1.0.0.jar server methode-article-internal-components-mapper.yaml`

## Endpoints

The transformation which takes place at each valid Kafka message can also be triggered by the `/map` endpoint.

### API

The internal components model is documented by the description of this non-public `/map` API.

For Blueprint style documentation, see [here](api.md).

API spec validation happens by `dredd`. It's linked with circleci, but to run it locally just type `dredd` in the project's top-level directory.

### Posting content to be mapped

Transformation can be triggered through a POST message containing a Methode article to http://localhost:11070/map
In case the required transformation is triggered to provide an article preview, you need to set a `preview` query parameter in the URL with `true` as value: 
e.g., http://localhost:11070/map?preview=true

### Healthcheck and good-to-go

A GET request to http://localhost:11071/healthcheck or http://localhost:11070/__health

A GET request to http://localhost:11071/__gtg

Health and gtg are based on methode-article-mapper's health endpoint, and kafka topics' availabilities for reading and writing.

## Internals

For article validation the service leverages on methode article mapper's `/map` endpoint.

## Example of transformation output
You can find an example of a transformed article below.
